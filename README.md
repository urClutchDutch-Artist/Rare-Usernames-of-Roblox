# Rare-Usernames-of-Roblox
A long list of rare usernames in Roblox.
### Hello, I've created a list of rare usernames.

(Formatted to devforum.roblox.com)

---

# Introduction

I'll have categories of them, you can click the little triangle to see them.

If you know of any I did NOT list, then PLEASE PM me about it, I would love to have a giant list of these rare usernames.

Also let's say I just say (example): "Spaced usernames", if you had a list of ALL the "spaced usernames" then if you want to PM me that I'll add it.

There are still hyper-links needed, names to be added, so it is a work in progress. Hope you enjoy!

Here they are!

---

# Names

Here are all the rare usernames, hope you enjoy, this took a lot of effort...

[details="Description"]

Below this is the rare usernames. There will be multiple categories (click the triangles to open them), and will contain descriptions, lists, names, and other information.

Let's jump into it, hope you enjoy!

[/details]

[details="Inappropriate Names"]

These are the most common types of rare usernames.

We’ve all ran into these, they bypass the filter to say something inappropriate, there are A LOT of these, you can likely find them in one of those “FollowingCoolPeople” accounts.

Unfortunately, there are so many of these accounts that a list is unavailable.

[/details]

[details="3 Character Names"]

3 character names are names that, well use 3 characters, including the 26 English letters, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 0, and also underscores (Example: AAA).

Popular ones are ones that make faces (Like the probably most famous, [0_0](https://www.roblox.com/users/9706143/profile))

All of these names have been taken, and the only way to get one is if Roblox were to entirely remove an account, and everything from it, and give the ID to someone (Not sure, but I think the account owner could do a Right to Erasure request (GDPR) to get it fully deleted).

The 3 character era ended on October 14, 2020, with the name [kfc](https://www.roblox.com/users/1949172449/profile).

Many people consider 4 character names rare as well, this ended on July 2nd, 2020.

Only 5-20 character names are left.

Unfortunately, there are so many of these accounts that a list is unavailable.

[/details]

[details=""." Accounts"]

These accounts have a "." in their username, any other ones are banned, though periods used to be a thing in VERY VERY VERY early Roblox, much before spaces, though most accounts just glitched it.

Only 8 accounts have a period in them, those accounts are:

[david.baszucki](https://www.roblox.com/users/24941/profile)

[erik.cassel](https://www.roblox.com/users/16/profile) (We love you Erik, shine bright.)

[foot.longer](https://www.roblox.com/users/1144/profile)

[mimi._.2121](https://www.roblox.com/users/101107950/profile)

[Mr.CoolRobloxPlayya101](https://www.roblox.com/users/45580898/profile)

[Mr.Dog](https://www.roblox.com/users/125309895/profile)

[Predator.John123](https://www.roblox.com/users/1057/profile)

[YUKI.N](https://www.roblox.com/users/713223/profile)

[/details]

[details="Multiple Underscores"]

There are some accounts that have multiple underscores, most are banned though.

Most were made at a certain time, or were glitched.

[details="List"]

[spoiler]i_love_blond_####s[/spoiler], j_murrda_67, The_J_Man, Lakeshot__9877 (2 underscores beside eachother), Roblox_Guy_56231, Arissa_loves_dance, bill_bo_baggins08, k_k_#, girlz_girlz_girlz, jake_m_45, juice_is_in_cups, honey_star_xo08, x_x_demon, Shadow_The_Hedgehog, mr_josh_smith, frag_m_sd, codie__78_hockey, chico__[spoiler]696969[/spoiler], chang_chang_chicken, nascar_fan_in_6, S_I_N, Killing_Machine_91, chance_the_killer, Conductor_Zak_599, lil_killa4_life, chandler_kill_u, _jp_, Frag_m_sd, Burn_the_Priest, and fully_sick_bro.

[/details]

This one is a bit interesting. Like the first one, it has 3 underscores, but they later changed their name so they never got banned: [Cardboard_wasHere *(formerly Andrew__Snipes_God)*](https://www.roblox.com/users/659071970/profile)

[/details]

[details="Spaced Names"]

At a very earlier time of Roblox, you used to be able to put spaces in your name.

Many, many accounts are out there still with spaces, here is an example: [Dragon Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/users/7504/profile)

Someaccounts also have multiple spaces, as example: [Son Of Compavalanche](https://www.roblox.com/users/8474300/profile), likely the most notorious. Something interesting with this account is if you look at the starter place, it shows as “Son0Of0Compavalanche’s place”, showing 0’s in places of spaces.

This is a list of 683 usernames with a space in them. (This comes from a third-party)

A portion of these are banned, and it is likely that not every spaced account is listed here.

Also some accounts put UNDETECTABLE spaces in front and back of the username (like [cupkakegal101](https://www.roblox.com/users/66547277/profile)), commonly used to get usernames that are taken, the the Spyro incident.

[/details]

If you find anything inappropriate I did not see in the list above, PM me IMMEDIATELY!

[/details]

[details="Same Usernames"]

Some accounts appear to have the same username, because of a glitch with spaces, or other strange things.

There are [1](https://www.roblox.com/users/7725/profile), [2](https://www.roblox.com/users/6760/profile), [3](https://www.roblox.com/users/6764/profile), 4 accounts with the name "Jacobxxduel (jacobxxduel)". The 4th is actually [Reverse_Polarity](https://www.roblox.com/users/1315/profile), which was his old username.

A case with the name "Spyro" happened because the main [Spyro](https://www.roblox.com/users/5099/profile), had their name copied TWICE because the other 2 accounts used spaces, that later didn't register. The other accounts were: [1](https://www.roblox.com/users/7722/profile) and [2](https://www.roblox.com/users/7408/profile).

I found this on a different [DevForum topic](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/previous-username-was-taken-by-newly-registered-user/749113), where someone took someone else's username (I don't believe any space glitches or anything), and apparently went to an old group they worked at, impersonating them.

I think this has happened before, though I stumbled upon this.

Later in this topic you'll find someone named builderboyiscool256/ , but also, there is an alternate version with the same name. The only difference is the about. Here they are: [builderboyiscool256](https://www.roblox.com/users/1451966433/profile) version 2.

There is 2 DAX accounts, plus both are 3 characters.

[DAX](https://www.roblox.com/users/1187/profile) 1, [DAX](https://www.roblox.com/users/11782/profile) 2.

There is 2 DracoAxeMaste accounts,

[DracoAxeMaster](https://www.roblox.com/users/5080/profile) 1, [DracoAxeMaster](https://www.roblox.com/users/5080/profile) 2.

There are two users with the name "bren609", [1](https://www.roblox.com/users/2758/profile) and [2](https://www.roblox.com/users/15739570/profile).

There are two users with the name Squidman".

There are two users with the name "Izon",[1](https://www.roblox.com/users/3113/profile) and [2](https://www.roblox.com/users/7751/profile).

There are two users with the name "Gannonrulz/gannonrulz", [1](https://www.roblox.com/users/5756/profile) and [2](https://www.roblox.com/users/7748/profile).

There are two users with the name "Yamut".

There are two users with the name "Buildy".

Something interesting is there are two "jacobxxdue"'s (NOT JACOBXXDUEL). [1](https://www.roblox.com/users/1653/profile) and [2](https://www.roblox.com/users/6763/profile)

Unfortunately, there are so many of these accounts that a full list is unavailable.

[details="Linebreaks"]

So, some names have the same username due to a "linebreak".

A line break is the "character" that appears when you hit enter for the next line (aka ![image|47x45](upload://yz7bPjeNik9phWmeJsW7er7dNKK.png) )

[/details]

There are other cases, though they still have to be found!

And of course you always have the lowercase L/capital i trick, the W and 2 V’s trick, and others always popup, but these are easily debunked.

[/details]

[details="Bypassed Characters"]

There have been some accounts with characters that aren't allowed in their usernames.

Here they are.

This account had a # in the name: [simcitiweegee *(formerly reset#2164240](https://www.roblox.com/users/19688759/profile)

*they were given that once banned, but changed upon appeal)*.

Another one had a Russian character in it (their username also appeared **bolded**): Мастер, he is now [valksyrie](https://www.roblox.com/users/144762910/profile).

There was also an account that used the character "ë", the account is: maël4000

Another account with a #, they were [#1234567890123](https://www.roblox.com/users/68180387/friends#!/friends) (which was a banned account)

During a 2016 glitch, some users put a hyphen/dash in their username, they were all reset-ed, though a banned account that was [[Content-Deleted-41043475]](https://www.roblox.com/users/41043475/friends#!/friends), had the spaces in the content deleted name replaced to hyphens/dashes.

A user on Roblox is named "Sellism". His status was "account close per request i will no longer be active because this account has been compromised by jessey and doodoo. i got it back but im closing it soon", so that brings a story. Anyways, his old username (it was hidden so their old usernames won't show it) was presliderguy123, do you see it? The character: ë? Well, no you don't... See before they were banned, if you highlighted the "e" in "pre", it would give you info of the Russian character: ë. There is also an account named "PreSliderGuy123", without the special e.

In a Faave video they said they got the name changed through Roblox Support, and many believe they injected the e with a code to make it do that.

An account named [builderbo󠁎yiscool256](https://www.roblox.com/users/1329329656/profile), (was listed earlier in same username part) has a tall version of this "☒" in between the o and the y like this "builderbo☒yiscool256", it works on the app and on website mode on mobile, but doesn't appear on PC. The weird thing is though, it’s part of the o in boy, it's one character, combined with the o. Basically "o☒" is one character, that when they made the account, it must've glitched in, sense it appears they didn't actually type it in. A weird thing about it, is that when you paste the "o☒" from the username, it shows as "o⍰" (the ⍰ isn't totally accurate, but looks about the same) in the URL box, again being one character.

Another account registered as “Ashxley_xoï»¿”, was an account that had THREE bypassed characters. As soon as the system noticed their signup, they were changed to “Ashxley_xo” and later banned.

Builder-Guy ; Has a - in it.

Super-Sylveon ; Has a - in it.

kоii ; This name has a Russian o in the name.

νexillologic and νictorious ; both of these names have a Greek v in them.

[/details]

[details="2 Character Names"]

There was a glitch in 2016 that allowed people to make 2 character names, like "hi" or "pi".

There was one specific account made from Roblox called "qa", they were an account for the QA testers, which means "Quality Assurance", basically they were testers making sure event games and big games were bug-free and "quality".

Another account was named [ya](https://www.roblox.com/users/127426416/profile), but was later changed to "Reset2822793", AND Roblox hid past usernames on the account.

[details="List"]

XZ, 42, FE, eu, Uk, Lo, Mo, Mi, Q9, HD, Er (reset), pn, 2d, ss, cc, kk, dj, cy, Tm, Do, No, Me, We, JP, Al, La, JJ, RV, tv, ro, ok, ow, bo, no, sr, xd, oz, is, in, up, KO, he, and qt.

[/details]

Above is a list of 2 character names, contains 41 names.

Known on 1/7/21, qa (along with user Toolbox) were unbanned from Roblox. Upon searching for qa in players, you get a error of "enter 3 characters" (even the BTRoblox extension quick player search doesn't make them show up), although his account exists here: https://www.roblox.com/users/6/profile.

[/details]

[details="No Username?"]

This account literally has no username...

This ID is 11123878.

The profile page is deleted, the API website shows an error there, sense someone took the "no username", no one else can.

This is the [account](https://www.roblox.com/users/11123878/friends#!/followers).

Their avatar is corrupted, no starting place, and they have no starter items according to the API website.

Some people have theorized that they use this character, it is in-between the brackets, and is so small that it won't highlight, but try to highlight and copy it: [­]

Others assume it is a line break.

If you saw this post, then you likely know the YouTuber Fave.

Fave suggested this theory (which I believe is correct), he looked at player and game ID's between this users ID and what their starterplace ID would be. This user's ID for a starterplace end up with a game made by a group.

Here is the problem though, back then group games were not a feature and every game had a user assigned to it.

In conclusion, this gave Roblox's system an error so they made this account that was assigned to the game.

It was a glitch.

[/details]

[details="21+ Character Names"]

Some people have bypassed the maximum 20 character name, and made some up to 50!

The longest username (THAT IS KNOWN) is [LongUsernameClubWillBeTheBiggestGroupEverCreatedBy](https://www.roblox.com/users/18804831/profile) This account also has some interesting history, including a group, and an exploiter. It is 50 characters.

There are other accounts that are 21+ characters affiliated with the one above. Those are: [ LongUsernameClubOwner](https://www.roblox.com/users/18804810/profile) (21), [ LongUsernameClubAdmin](https://www.roblox.com/users/18804819/profile) (21), and [HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH](https://www.roblox.com/users/18810882/profile) (50). The only reason why I don't put this one as first even though the most characters one and this one have the exact same character count, is that this account is just a bunch of H's, as the other one is a set of words.

All of these have close ID's, and have been hacked.

Most of them have a T-Shirt linked that is [nds](https://www.roblox.com/catalog/5185789863/nds)

Funny enough, in the comments of that T-Shirt there is a 21+ character username, who is [thisusernamebelongstosomeonenamedjusssssssssssstin](https://www.roblox.com/users/18819519/profile).

One of them were named after the "Never Gonna Give You Up" song meme, and made the name [NeverGonnaGiveYouUpNeverGonnaLetYouDown](https://www.roblox.com/users/18785718/profile)

thenoobkingofrobloxiankind12345 is a 21+ character username account that also has premium and is selling limited's. Unfortunately, as of 1/8/21 they have been terminated.

[noobnoobnoobnoobnoobnoobnoobnoobnoobnoobnoob](https://www.roblox.com/users/18942797/profile) is an account that has 44+ characters, or noob said 11 times (4x11=44).

This account was entirely intended to be like this because the status proves that they're aware of their username being 44 characters.

[Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis]( https://www.roblox.com/users/18669840/profile) is a 45’er, which their name is actually the biggest word in English.

Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious is an account that has been terminated, which is a word that had a song from “Mary Poppins”, an American movie actress.

[ipad1000000000000000000000000000000](https://www.roblox.com/users/17978208/profile), is an account that was pretty much making fun of Apple for making phone names with just a number at the end.

[oooooooooommmmmmmmmmgggggggggg](https://www.roblox.com/users/18965524/profile) is an account with is just making fun of people who use varieties of “OMG”.

[KYLEKYLEKYLEKYLEKYLEKYLEKYLEKYLEKYLEKYLEKYLEKYLEKY](https://www.roblox.com/users/18790131/profile).

There are tons of these accounts, however a popular variety is literally just “ha” over and over again, like these accounts: [1](https://www.roblox.com/users/18759894/profile), [2](https://www.roblox.com/users/18793174/profile), [3](https://www.roblox.com/users/18788919/profile).

Unfortunately, there are so many of these accounts that a full list is unavailable.

[details="Deleted/Reset Usernames"]

-Content deleted accounts have [ and ], along with spaces, and are frequently over 20 characters.

-Accounts used to/can become yyc(numbers), reset(numbers), request(numbers), or [ Account Deleted (numbers)], and also sometimes there are unique cases like ResetUser_(numbers).

-Many of these accounts are banned, or the username reset while still existing.

-Sometimes their status/about stays.

-etc.

Look at this person's following, most of them are reset accounts, so you can see quite a lot of them; [here](https://www.roblox.com/users/1418313983/friends#!/following).

Unfortunately, there are so many of these accounts that a list is unavailable.

[details="Other"]

-An account that was named [spoiler]####you[/spoiler] was changed to "loveyouroblox", and deleted, but later on another account did it, and was terminated.

-Many older accounts broke the username current rules.

-(THIS IS PATCHED) You can enter the username "hs4", or “noli” on the sign up page, it'll say you can use the name, and upon signing up, it'll say an error occurred, now this glitch has been patched (as of 12/30/20) and it says the usernames are just "taken", even though there are no users with the name.

-The account with the most username changes is [Fierzaa](https://www.roblox.com/users/85382088/profile) with 339 usernames!

-Many accounts have bad words in them, but are not detected because of the way they put them.

An example is [spoiler][#l##b##_t#r](https://www.roblox.com/users/1786266051/profile)[/spoiler], or also [spoiler][M#ST#RB#T##N](https://www.roblox.com/users/2016409589/profile)[/spoiler]

-You likely know the [LilNasX](https://www.roblox.com/users/1981119333/profile) account. Well, LilNasX being a big celebrity, and joining Roblox way after his fame, you suppose there would be fan accounts, and there are. In fact, one account was named "LilNasX", which is now Reset24171514. You see, Roblox Reset that person’s username and then terminated them, which if they were a real player who had stats in games and all, that's kind of messed up. I believe they did this with AvaMax to (not sure what the ID was). And once again they did it, this time with Gucci to 2 accounts. First one was: Reset168067 Second one was: ResetUser_9055 (unique deleted name).

-The 14,000,000th account is quite strange.

First of all it's the 14,000,000th account, it has a game with a funky font description and name, the about part is a strange code, they're friends with many 3 character accounts that are just 3 numbers which most share the same looking avatar, and Google gives a translation from Vietnamese to English.

If you leave it in Vietnamese, the follow button says "Follow", but changing it to English, the follow button says "Theo dõi", which is Vietnamese for follow.

If you click the Theo dõi, it follows as expected, same with the follow button while in Vietnamese, and the unfollow button has no problem.

I assume sense the account has weird phrases on it, it did that to the follow button for some odd reason.

The account is called [Standardization](https://www.roblox.com/users/14000000/profile).

-Just Cool Names/Users.

[Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/users/1/profile), [builderman](https://www.roblox.com/users/156/profile), [John Doe](https://www.roblox.com/users/2/profile), [Jane Dow](https://www.roblox.com/users/3/profile), [qa](https://www.roblox.com/users/6/profile), Admin (first user), [Toolbox](https://www.roblox.com/users/8/profile), [david.baszucki](https://www.roblox.com/users/24941/profile) [erik.cassel](https://www.roblox.com/users/16/profile) (we love you Erik), and there are others, though these early users are made by Roblox or have important history. (Also here I wanted to mention 1blox, as this is a very early user, a rare username, and also the person who created builderman's shirt, however the shirt got deleted and they were terminated).

-The UserID's 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19, and 20 are erased, these are all unrecoverable, even archives don’t work.

We have found a third-party forum listing info about these accounts, although they have no evidence, the page is extremely confusing and unorganized, but I will try to cite is. Just keep in mind that warning because it could be entirely false.

[details="Missing User’s 4-20 Info"]

ID 4: The User ID #4 was thought to be the first ROBLOX user who was not an administrator.

The username is "Richard Rove". It is also possible that there is a mistake between IDs 4/14.

It is believed that they had the avatar of the old noob.

ID 5: The user with the ID of 5 was named b##bs, it is possible that they have been moved to ID: 37738.

It is believed that they had the avatar of the old noob.

ID 7: This user was named "Duh", and was POSSIBLY banned for spam or being PG'ed.

I uploaded a image that is possibly related to them as a decal :https://www.roblox.com/library/6235116230/Place-Image-ID7.

ID 9: This user is heavily unknown, but is believed to be named "legit of spam".

ID 10: This person was named "ur_f######_Dumb" (which is a multiple underscore name), it is also possible that there is a mistake between IDs 9/10.

ID 11: This was a user named "LOL", tested with a bot API feature.

ID 12: This was to test out with the ID moving feature back in 2005 where all 2004 users ID's would be moved. The 12th ID was test where the Rich account's ID was. It was moved and the ID 12 was taken by another account for the ID's were available. The name is entirely unknown.

ID 13: This user has no info and is entirely unknown, all that is known is that it is terminated.

ID 14: This user was either the account named "f###". It is unknown if they have the ID of 4, or "Richard Rove" does.

ID 15: The only thing known is that they possibly were named: "test test 123" and that they possibly had the avatar of the old noob.

ID 19: There is nothing known on this user at all, and name/avatar is being requested.

ID 20: Their name could've been "Richard Groove", however this is unknown. There is no other info on this account.

You may of also heard of the ID’s 116-154. There is no valid information on them, besides that they may have been used to test the old banning system, however 152 was possibly ROBLOX’s original ID.

[/details]

-The first 500 users, why not? (This comes from a third-party, and some information could not be correct)

[details="500 First Users List"]

This is a list of the first 500 ROBLOX users, ordered by ID. There are also join dates. If there isn't a join date for a certain account, then it is unknown, either due to the account being deleted or other circumstances. The reason why the join date for ROBLOX says 2007 is because ROBLOX's ID was switched in mid-2007, so this list keeps his original join date.

(Hey-a the creator of this whole post here, so according to another source showing the first 50 users, it shows what the 4-20 users POSSIBLY could’ve originally been so I labeled their name as that with a question mark in parenthesis, the first 50 ORIGINAL users before their ID’s were swapped will be listed later in this post.)

This list contains such as ROBLOX, builderman, test accounts, the nuevu accounts, Admin, qa, Toolbox, and many more. Just keep in mind many of these had their ID’s switched. Take Admin and a for example, they used to be 1 and 2. I believe Telamon used to be 261, but is now 13645. There are many of these cases. Basically some of these accounts have their original ID while some have a moved ID (which is believed why the users 4-20 and maybe 116-154 are missing), take billturner and elvisarea51 for example, their ID’s have been argued that they’re 35 and 36, 50 and 51, 4 and 5, 12, etc. so there is just no answer to some like that.

A lot of these are also terminated, here is a list of ones terminated (NOT IN ORDER, NOR ARE CAPITALS PROPER)

There you have a giant room of random early accounts.

Your welcome.

[/details]

-So, have you ever gotten an error and seen builderman in his OBC suit?

Well I tried to discover that.

After looking through many types of errors, I finally found one that showed shows for IP bans, or if you're not allowed on a page, it shows an ID badge with a number and a barcode.

The barcode scans to nothing, however the ID is 169, and user 169 is named [brickmason](https://www.roblox.com/users/169/profile).

How epic is that?

-Admins

I feel like this is quite self-explanatory.

Many accounts are admins.

You can find these people that are in the following groups:

-The Badge Man; “[TurboBuildersClubMan](https://www.roblox.com/users/3701025/profile)”

If you didn’t get the title, this guy has a lot of badges. Not player badges, Roblox badges. He has exactly 100 [Homestead](https://www.roblox.com/info/roblox-badges#Badge6) badges, and also exactly 20 [Friendship](https://www.roblox.com/info/roblox-badges#Badge2) badges, along with a single [Veteran](https://www.roblox.com/info/roblox-badges#Badge12) badge.

-The Admin Panel Account
According to records from 2009, this account named "SethiXzon" was the format for the admin  moderation panel, it showed types of bans.

[/details]

You may have seen some accounts that are named example “FollowAllRareUsers”, here are some I recommend to see their following: [1](https://www.roblox.com/users/1515614706/friends#!/following), [2](https://www.roblox.com/users/320649590/profile), and you can literally find more by just typing into player search something like “FollowAllRare”.

# Conclusion

That wraps up all the rare names that I know of, again please PM me for specific ones I missed, if an account gets banned, things like that.

When I get informed about something, I add it, and it'll go back the the latest list to keep this train alive!

# Credits

Clutchy: Teehee, applause to me for doing most of the work!

I typed out the whole thing and went on an adventure looking for these, I did a lot of the categories and names here, and I have been following accounts that have rare names (or qualities to their account) so I could keep up.

KonekoKitten: I originally started this because of his video on rare usernames, and where some of the names came from.

Faave: His rare username videos gave me a lot of categories and names here to put in, also his video kept me quite motivated here.

@Family1sMyLife gave me a lot of names.

I recommend that you check out their [following](https://www.roblox.com/users/320649590/friends#!/following) because they follow many rare/bypassed names!

@Ty_Scripts gave some names and also provided information.

[roblox####1](https://devforum.roblox.com/u/robloxfoda1/summary): contributed, also this person is a rare name, as the word between roblox and 1 is [spoiler]the F word (no saying obviously)[/spoiler] in Brazillian Portuguese.

@1xc1zh provided information

I wanted to say that this took actual hours. There were 98 topics made when this was first created (3 hours), plus all the edits.

By the way, anything censored with #'s was intentional.

Thanks!

New update (for anyone who is following), added some names I found, detailed some categories, and also added a new segment to the “Other” category.
Still I’m trying to figure out a way to show banned accounts without using an offsite link or making tons of bulletin board posts (because that is annoying).
There will still be some renovation soon, no accounts here have been banned fortunately, I may over time work on hyper-linking the spaced accounts list, I might make an account and have it follow all (unbanned) accounts, and some other stuff.
Thanks for everyone’s support on this and I plan big things in the future with this (like a whole game!)

[quote="TheChasingBoy, post:9, topic:868350"]
